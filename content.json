For every $x\\in T$, denote $\\mathop{\\mathrm{ht}}(x):=\\mathop{\\mathrm{otp}}(x_\\downarrow,&lt;_T)$.For every $A\\subseteq\\kappa$, let $T\\restriction A:=\\{ x\\in T\\mid \\mathop{\\mathrm{ht}}(x)\\in A\\}$.Note that, for every $\\alpha&lt;\\kappa$, $T_\\alpha:=\\{ x\\in T\\mid \\mathop{\\mathrm{ht}}(x)=\\alpha\\}$ and $T\\restriction\\alpha$ have size ${&lt;}\\kappa$.A maximal linearly ordered subset of $T$ is called a branch. A $\\kappa$-Aronszajn tree is a $\\kappa$-tree with no chains of size $\\kappa$. A $\\kappa$-Souslin tree is a $\\kappa$-tree with no chains or anti-chains of size $\\kappa$. A $\\kappa$-Kurepa tree is a $\\kappa$-tree with at least $\\kappa^+$ branches. An $\\aleph_1$-tree $T$ is special if there is a function $f:T\\rightarrow \\omega$ such that whenever $s&lt;_T t$ we have $f(t)\\neq f(s)$. The next well-known lemma shows that Souslin trees are similar to Luzin spaces in the sense that every large subset of a Souslin tree is somewhere dense. Lemma (folklore). Suppose $\\mathbf T=(T,{&lt;_T})$ is a $\\kappa$-Souslin tree and $B\\subseteq T$ is a subset with $|B|=\\kappa$. Then there exists $w\\in T$ such that $w^\\uparrow\\cap B$ is cofinal in $w^\\uparrow$. Definition. Let $(T,&lt;_T)$ be a normal $\\omega_1$-tree, a sub-tree of $T$ is a subset $S$ which is a normal $\\omega_1$-tree and $S$ is downward closed under $&lt;_T$ (i.e., if $t\\in S$ and $s&lt;_T t$ then $s\\in S$). A base for $T$ is a set $\\mathcal B$ of sub-trees such that for every sub-tree $S$ of $T$ there is $A\\in \\mathcal B$ with $A\\subseteq S$. Remark. Let us observe that any $\\kappa$-Souslin tree $T$ has a basis of size $\\kappa$. Define for every $t\\in T$ the set $T_t:=\\{s\\in T \\mid s\\leq_T t\\text{ or }t\\leq_T s\\}$, then by the Lemma the set $\\{ T_t \\mid t\\in T \\}$ is a base for $T$. Theorem (Todorčević): Suppose there is an $\\aleph_1$-Kurepa tree with at least $\\kappa$-branches. Then there is a special $\\aleph_1$-Aronszajn tree for which every base has cardinality greater equal to $\\kappa$. Proof. Let $(K,\\leq_K)$ be an $\\aleph_1$-Kurepa tree with $\\kappa$ branches and let $T$ be a special $\\aleph_1$-Aronszajn tree. Let $S=K\\otimes T :=\\{ (k,t) \\mid k\\in K, t\\in T\\text{ and }\\mathop{\\mathrm{ht}}(k)=\\mathop{\\mathrm{ht}}(t) \\}$ with the coordinatewwise ordering, i.e. $(k,t)&lt; (a,b) \\iff k&lt;_K a \\wedge t&lt;_T b$. Then $S$ is clearly an $\\aleph_1$-Aronszajn tree, for $S_\\alpha = K_\\alpha\\times T_\\alpha$ for all $\\alpha&lt;\\omega_1$ and if $B\\subseteq S$ is an uncountable branch then $\\{t\\in T \\mid \\exists k[(k,t)\\in B]\\}$ would be an uncountable branch through $T$, which is impossible. If $f:T\\rightarrow \\omega$ is a witnesses that $T$ is special then we define the function $g:S\\rightarrow \\omega$ by $g(k,t)=f(t)$, this clearly witnesses that $S$ is also special. Finally, let $\\langle b_\\xi \\mid \\xi&lt;\\kappa \\rangle$ be a sequence of disjoint uncountable branches through $K$. Let $A_\\xi := \\{ (k,t)\\in S \\mid k\\in b_\\xi\\}$ then it is easily to see thatfor every $\\xi\\neq \\eta$ in $\\kappa$, we have $b_\\xi\\cap b_\\eta$ is countable, hence $A_\\xi \\cap A_\\eta$ is also countable, and it is clear that $A_\\xi$ is a subtree of $S$. Suppose we have a basis $\\mathcal B$ of cardinality less than $\\kappa$, but this is impossible since for every $\\xi&lt;\\kappa$ there must exists some $B\\in \\mathcal B$ such that $B\\subseteq A_\\xi$. ◻","link":"/2021/01/29/Bases_for_Aronszajn_trees/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Aronszajn tree","slug":"Aronszajn-tree","link":"/tags/Aronszajn-tree/"}],"categories":[{"name":"Math","slug":"Math","link":"/categories/Math/"}]}
